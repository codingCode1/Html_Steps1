         <h1>HTML Blog</h1>
        <p>I have used a favicon of a golf player that looks really cool. I must admit I am super proud of this addition since I am not one to care much about        styling.
         I know at some point I will have to learn CSS, however, as of right now, I am only intersted in creating a 90's style website with HTML. My plan is to learn about HTML tags and getting familiar with their use.  Mozilla developer network has become my main source of information along <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/tag/html/">Freecodecamp.org</a>.
